Development of AI agents to play Pokémon-Showdown battles, thanks to deep learning or machine learning techniques.

I first start my tries with Reinforcement Learning, later I also want to try Random Forests and mix with symbolic AI.

This project is made possible thanks to the poké-env library.

I first focus myself on random battles, especially gen8randombattle and gen4randombattle avoiding teambuilding requiries. In the futur, I also want to try implementing automatic teambuilding.

gen4randombattle seems the best compromise since there is one less type (Fairy), there is no special mechanic like mega-evolutions or dynamax. And also I've played it a lot so I am able to understand the games, and notice some mistakes.


Update : we only run on gen4randombattle for embedding_2 and beyond, and other .py files
